# Nexxt

## Summary
[Nexxt](https://www.nexxt.xyz) is a collection of interactive, hands-on courses for tech skills.

We launched this project for two reasons:

1. New technologies are constantly entering the market, making it difficult for developers to stay on top of the newest technologies.
2. Developers garner a huge amount of knowledge over time, but there's not a good platform yet for them to share what they know via interactive courses with built in hands-on learning opportunities.

Our goal is to release a number of courses in the coming months by working with developers and educators to enable them to share what they know with the world. If we're successful, we'll be able to help those in need of training find what they are looking for and enable our authors to share their knowledge in a valuable and meaningful way.

## How This Works

This repository will be used to track all Nexxt courses, enabling us to share course development progress (via Issues) and get feedback from the community on what each course should contain (via a course Issue).

Our hope is that together we can decide what courses are most valuable and work together to make sure those courses cover the right subject matter.
