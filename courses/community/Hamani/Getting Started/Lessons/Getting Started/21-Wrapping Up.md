Congratulations for completing your first Hanami project!

Let's review what we've done: we've traced requests through Hanami's major frameworks to understand how they relate to each other; we've seen how we can model our domain using entities and repositories; we've seen solutions for building forms, maintaining our database schema, and validating user input.

We've come a long way, but there's still plenty more to explore. Explore the [other guides][1], the [Hanami API documentation][42], read the [source code][43] and follow the [blog][44].

Above all, enjoy building amazing things!
