Before we dive in, let's get some prerequisites out of the way.

First, we're going to assume a basic knowledge of developing web applications.

You should also be familiar with [Bundler](http://bundler.io), [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org), working with a terminal and building apps using the [Model, View, Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) paradigm.

Lastly, in this guide we'll be using a [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) database. This and Ruby are already installed in this lesson envrionment, so you can just jump right in and learn Hanami!
