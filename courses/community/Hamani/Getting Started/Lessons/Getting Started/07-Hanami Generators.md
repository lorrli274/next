Hanami ships with various **generators** to save on typing some of the code involved in adding new functionality. In our terminal, enter:
    
```    
$ bundle exec hanami generate action web books#index
```

This will generate a new action index in the books controller of the web application. It gives us an empty action, view and template; it also adds a default route to `apps/web/config/routes.rb`:
    
```ruby    
get '/books', to: 'books#index'
```

To make our test pass, we need to edit our newly generated template file in `apps/web/templates/books/index.html.erb`:
    
    
```erb
<h1>Bookshelf</h1>
<h2>All books</h2>

<div id="books">
  <div class="book">
    <h3>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</h3>
    <p>by <strong>Martin Fowler</strong></p>
  </div>

  <div class="book">
    <h3>Test Driven Development</h3>
    <p>by <strong>Kent Beck</strong></p>
  </div>
</div>
```

The output will also contain a skipped test. This is due to an autogenerated test in `spec/web/views/books/index_spec.rb`.

The terminology of controllers and actions might be confusing, so let's clear this up: actions form the basis of our Hanami applications; controllers are mere modules that group several actions together. So while the "controller" is conceptually present in our project, in practice we only deal with actions.

We've used a generator to create a new endpoint in our application.

But one thing you may have noticed is that our new template contains the same `<h1>` as our `home/index.html.erb` template.
Let's fix that.
