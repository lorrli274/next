Hello! If you're reading this page, it's very likely that you want to learn more about [Hanami](https://c.next.xyz/hanami). That's great, congrats! If you're looking for new ways to build maintainable, secure, faster and testable web applications, you're in good hands.

**Hanami is built for people like you.**

However, whether you're a total beginner or an experienced developer **this learning process can be hard**.

Over time, we build expectations about how things should be, and it can be painful to change. But without change, there is no challenge and without challenge, there is no growth.

Sometimes a feature doesn't look right, that doesn't mean it's you. It can be a matter of formed habits, a design fallacy or even a bug.

In this guide we will set up our first Hanami project and build a simple bookshelf web application. We'll touch on all the major components of Hanami framework, all guided by tests.

If you feel alone, or frustrated, don't give up, jump in the Hanami [chat](http://chat.hanamirb.org) and ask for help. There will be someone more than happy to talk with you.
