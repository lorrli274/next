Congratulations for completing your first Hanami project!

Let's review what we've done: we've traced requests through Hanami's major frameworks to understand how they relate to each other; we've seen how we can model our domain using entities and repositories; we've seen solutions for building forms, maintaining our database schema, and validating user input.

We've come a long way, but there's still plenty more to explore. Explore the [other guides](http://hanamirb.org/guides), the [Hanami API documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/hanami), read the [source code](https://github.com/hanami) and follow the [blog](http://hanamirb.org/blog).

Above all, enjoy building amazing things!
