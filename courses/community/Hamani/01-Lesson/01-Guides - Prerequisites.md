You should also be familiar with [Bundler][5], [Rake][6], working with a terminal and building apps using the [Model, View, Controller][7] paradigm.

Lastly, in this guide we'll be using a [SQLite][8] database. If you want to follow along, make sure you have a working installation of Ruby 2.3+ and SQLite 3+ on your system.
