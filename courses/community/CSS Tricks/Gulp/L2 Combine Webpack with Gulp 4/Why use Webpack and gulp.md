#### Static File Handling

Gulp can handle **static assets** better than Webpack. The Copy Webpack can also copy files from your source to your build folder but when it comes to watching file deletion or changes like overriding an image, `gulp.watch` is a safer bet.

#### Server Environment

Webpack also comes with a local **server environment** via Webpack Dev Server, but using BrowserSync has some features you might not want to miss:

* CSS/HTML/image injection for non-app projects
* multiple device testing out of the box
* includes an admin panel for more control
* bandwidth throttling for speed and loading tests

#### Compilation Time

Sass gets **processed** by node-sass much quicker than by Webpack's combination of sass-loader, css-loader and extract-text-webpack-plugin.

#### Convenience

In Webpack, you have to import your CSS and SVG files for instance into JavaScript to process them which can be quite tricky and confusing sometimes. With Gulp, you don't need to adjust your workflow.
