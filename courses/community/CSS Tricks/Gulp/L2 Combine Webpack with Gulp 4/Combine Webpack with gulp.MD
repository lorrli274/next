[**Webpack**](https://webpack.github.io/) is great when it comes to module bundling and working with frameworks like Vue or React, but it is a bit more awkward when handling static assets (like CSS). You might be more used to handling your static assets with something like [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), and there are some pretty good reasons for that. 

Still, the amount of JavaScript in our static projects is growing, so to compensate, let's make use of Webpack, while remaining in gulp. In this course, specifically, gulp 4. We'll use modern techniques to build an easily maintainable workflow, including the powerful and useful **Hot Module Reloading** (HMR).
