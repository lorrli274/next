### What's Gulp

**Gulp** is a tool that helps you out with several tasks when it comes to web development. It's often used to do front end tasks like: 

* Spinning up a web server
* Reloading the browser automatically whenever a file is saved
* Using preprocessors like Sass or LESS
* Optimizing assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images

This is not a comprehensive list of things Gulp can do. If you're crazy enough, you can even build a static site generator with Gulp. So yes, Gulp is extremely powerful, but you'll have to learn how to use Gulp if you want to create your own customized build processes. 

Before we dive into working with Gulp, let's talk about why you may want to use Gulp as opposed to other similar tools. 

### Why Gulp

Tools like Gulp are often referred to as **build tools** because they are tools for running the tasks for building a website. The two most popular build tools out there right now are Gulp and **Grunt**. There are others of course,  like **Broccoli:** which focuses on asset compilation, ans is one of the most common build tool tasks. 

The main difference is how you configure a workflow with them. Gulp configurations tend to be much shorter and simpler when compared with Grunt. Gulp also tends to run faster. 

Let's now move on and find out how to setup a workflow with Gulp.

### What we're setting up

By the end of this course, you'll have a workflow that does the tasks we outlined in the first step

* Spins up a web server
* Compiles Sass to CSS
* Refreshes the browser automatically whenever you save a file
* Optimizes all assets (CSS, JS, fonts, and images) for production

You'll also learn how to **chain together** different tasks into simple commands that are easy to understand and execute.

Lets get started in the next lesson! 

### Installing Gulp

Let's begin by installing Gulp onto your computer. Type this into the terminal on the right:

```
$ npm install gulp -g
```

The `npm install` command  used here is a command that uses **Node Package Manager** (npm) to install Gulp in this lesson. 

The `-g` flag in this command tells npm to install Gulp globally onto your computer, which allows you to use the `gulp` command anywhere in the lesson. 

Now that you have Gulp installed, let's make a project that uses it!  

### Creating a Gulp Project

First, we'll create a folder called *project* to server as our project root as we move through this tutorial. Run the `npm init` command from inside that directory:
    
``` 
# ... from within our project folder
$ npm init
```

The `npm init` command creates a *package.json* file for your project which stores information about the project, like the _dependencies_ used in the project (Gulp is an example of a dependency).

`npm init` will prompt you: 

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/codevolve-assets/internal/courses/Gulp/11.png)

Once the `package.json` file is created, we can install Gulp into the project by using the following command: 
    
```
$ npm install gulp --save-dev
```

This time, we're installing Gulp into `project` instead of installing it globally, which is why there are some differences in the command. 

You'll see that the `sudo` keyword isn't required because we're not installing Gulp globally, so `-g` is also not necessary. We've added `\--save-dev`, which tells the computer to add `gulp` as a dev dependency in `package.json`.

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/codevolve-assets/internal/courses/Gulp/12.png)

If you check the project folder when the command has finished executing, you should see that Gulp has created a `node_modules` folder. You should also see a `gulp` folder within `node_modules`. 

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/codevolve-assets/internal/courses/Gulp/13.png)

We're almost ready to start working with Gulp. Before we do so, we have to be clear on how we're going to use Gulp for the project, and part of that is deciding on a directory structure.

### Determining Folder Structure

Gulp is flexible enough to work with any folder structure. You'll just have to understand the inner workings before tweaking it for your project. 

For this course, we will use the structure of a generic webapp: 
    
```
|- app/
		|- css/
		|- fonts/
		|- images/ 
		|- index.html
		|- js/ 
		|- scss/
|- dist/
|- gulpfile.js
|- node_modules/
|- package.json
```

In this structure, we'll use the `app` folder for development purposes, while the `dist` (as in "distribution") folder is used to contain optimized files for the production site. 

Since `app` is used for development purposes, all our code will be placed in `app`. 

We'll have to keep this folder structure in mind when we work on our Gulp configurations. Now, let's begin by creating your first Gulp task in `gulpfile.js`, which stores all Gulp configurations. 

### Writing Your First Gulp Task

The first step to using Gulp is to **require** it in the gulpfile. 
    
``` javascript
var gulp = require('gulp');
```

The require statement tells Node to look into the *node_modules* folder for a package named `gulp`. Once the package is found, we assign its contents to the variable `gulp`. 

We can now begin to write a gulp task with this `gulp` variable. The basic syntax of a gulp task is:
    
```javascript
gulp.task('task-name', function() {
	// Stuff here
});
```

`task-name` refers to the name of the task, which would be used whenever you want to run a task in Gulp. You can also run the same task in the command line by writing `gulp task-name`. 

To test it out, let's create a `hello` task that says `Hello Zell!`. 
    
```javascript
gulp.task('hello', function() {
	console.log('Hello Zell');
});
```

We can run this task with `gulp hello` in the command line. 
    
```bash
$ gulp hello
```

The command line will return a log that says `Hello Zell!`. 

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/codevolve-assets/internal/courses/Gulp/14.png)

Gulp tasks are usually a bit more complex than this. It usually contains two additional Gulp methods, plus a variety of Gulp plugins. 

Here's what a real task may look like: 
    
```javascript
gulp.task('task-name', function () {
	return gulp.src('source-files') // Get source files with gulp.src
		.pipe(aGulpPlugin()) // Sends it through a gulp plugin
		.pipe(gulp.dest('destination')) // Outputs the file in the destination folder
})
```

As you can see, a real task takes in two additional gulp methods â€” `gulp.src` and `gulp.dest`. 

`gulp.src` tells the Gulp task what files to use for the task, while `gulp.dest` tells Gulp where to output the files once the task is completed. 

### Preprocessing With Gulp

We can compile Sass to CSS in Gulp with the help of a plugin called [gulp-sass][15]. You can install gulp-sass into your project by using the `npm install` command like we did for `gulp`. 

We'd also want to use the `\--save-dev` flag to ensure that gulp-sass gets added to `devDependencies` in `package.json`. 
    
```bash    
$ npm install gulp-sass --save-dev
```

We have to `require` gulp-sass from the `node_modules` folder just like we did with `gulp` before we can use the plugin. 
    
```javascript    
var gulp = require('gulp');
// Requires the gulp-sass plugin
var sass = require('gulp-sass');
```

We can use gulp-sass by replacing `aGulpPlugin()` with `sass()`. Since the task is meant to compile Sass into CSS, let's name it `sass`. 
    
```javascript    
gulp.task('sass', function(){
	return gulp.src('source-files')
		.pipe(sass()) // Using gulp-sass
		.pipe(gulp.dest('destination'))
});
```

We'll need to provide the `sass` task with source files and a destination for the task to work, so let's create a `styles.scss` file in the `app/scss` folder. This file will be added to the `sass` task in `gulp.src`. 

We want to output the eventual `styles.css` file to the `app/css` folder, which would be the `destination` for `gulp.dest`. 
    
```javascript    
gulp.task('sass', function(){
	return gulp.src('app/scss/styles.scss')
		.pipe(sass()) // Converts Sass to CSS with gulp-sass
		.pipe(gulp.dest('app/css'))
});
```

We'll want to test that the `sass` task is working as we want it to. To do so, we can add a Sass function within `styles.scss`. 
    
```scss    
// styles.scss
.testing {
	width: percentage(5/7);
}
```

If you run `gulp sass` in the command line, you should now be able to see that a `styles.css` file was created in `app/css`. In addition, it has the code where `percentage(5/7)` was evaluted into `71.42857%`. 
    
```css    
/* styles.css */
.testing {
	width: 71.42857%; 
}
```

That's how we know that the `sass` task works! 

Sometimes we need the ability to compile more than one `.scss` file into CSS at the same. We can do so with the help of Node globs. 

### Globbing in Node

Globs are matching patterns for files that allow you to add more than one file into *gulp.src*. It's like regular expressions, but specifically for file paths. 

When you use a glob, the computer checks file names and paths for the specified pattern. If the pattern exists, then a file is matched. 

Most workflows with Gulp tend to only require 4 different globbing patterns: 

1. `*.scss`: The `*` pattern is a wildcard that matches any pattern in the current directory. In this case, we're matching any files ending with `.scss` in the root folder (`project`).
2. `**/*.scss`: This is a more extreme version of the `*` pattern that matches any file ending with `.scss` in the root folder and any child directories.
3. `!not-me.scss`: The `!` indicates that Gulp should exclude the pattern from its matches, which is useful if you had to exclude a file from a matched pattern. In this case, `not-me.scss` would be excluded from the match.
4. `*.+(scss|sass)`: The plus `+` and parentheses `()` allows Gulp to match multiple patterns, with different patterns separated by the pipe `|` character. In this case, Gulp will match any file ending with `.scss` or `.sass` in the root folder.

Since we know about globbing now, we can replace `app/scss/styles.scss` with a `scss/**/*.scss` pattern, which matches any file with a `.scss` extension in `app/scss` or a child directory. 
    
```javascript
    gulp.task('sass', function() {
      return gulp.src('app/scss/**/*.scss') // Gets all files ending with .scss in app/scss and children dirs
        .pipe(sass())
        .pipe(gulp.dest('app/css'))
    })
```

Any other Sass file that's found within `app/scss` would automatically be included into the `sass` task with this change. If you add a *print.scss*  file into the project, you'll see that `print.css` will be generated in `app/css`.

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/codevolve-assets/internal/courses/Gulp/17.png)

We've now managed to compile all Sass files into CSS files with a single command. The question is, what good does it do if we have to run `gulp sass` manually every time we want to compile Sass into CSS? 

Luckily, we can tell Gulp to automatically run the `sass` task whenever a file is saved through a process called "watching".

### Watching Sass files for changes

Gulp provides us with a **watch** method that checks to see if a file was saved. The syntax for the `watch` method is: 
    
```javascript
// Gulp watch syntax
gulp.watch('files-to-watch', ['tasks', 'to', 'run']); 
```

If we want to watch all Sass files and run the `sass` task whenever a Sass file is saved, we just have to replace `files-to-watch` with the `app/scss/**/*.scss`, and [`'tasks', 'to', 'run']` with [`'sass']`: 
    
```javascript
// Gulp watch syntax
gulp.watch('app/scss/**/*.scss', ['sass']); 
```

More often though, we'll want to watch more than one type of file at once. To do so, we can group together multiple watch processes into a `watch` task: 
    
```javascript
gulp.task('watch', function(){
gulp.watch('app/scss/**/*.scss', ['sass']); 
// Other watchers
})
```

If you ran the `gulp watch` command right now, you'll see that Gulp starts watching immediately. 

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/codevolve-assets/internal/courses/Gulp/19.png)

And that it automatically runs the `sass` task whenever you save a `.scss` file. 

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/codevolve-assets/internal/courses/Gulp/20.gif)

Let's take it a step further and make Gulp reload the browser whenever we save a `.scss` file with the help of [Browser Sync][http://www.browsersync.io].

### Live-Reloading with Browser Sync
**Browser Sync** helps make web development easier by spinning up a web server that helps us do live-reloading easily. It has other features, like synchronizing actions across multiple devices. 

We'll first have to install Browser Sync: 
    
```bash
$ npm install browser-sync --save-dev
```

You may have noticed that there isn't a `gulp-` prefix when we install Browser Sync. This is because Browser Sync works with Gulp, so we don't have to use a plugin. 

To use Browser Sync, we'll have to `require` Browser Sync.
    
```javascript
var browserSync = require('browser-sync').create();
```

We need to create a `browserSync` task to enable Gulp to spin up a server using Browser Sync. Since we're running a server, we need to let Browser Sync know where the root of the server should be. In our case, it's the `app` folder:
    
```javascript
gulp.task('browserSync', function() {
	browserSync.init({
		server: {
			baseDir: 'app'
		},
	})
})
```

We also have to change our `sass` task slightly so Browser Sync can inject new CSS styles (update the CSS) into the browser whenever the `sass` task is ran. 
    
```javascript
gulp.task('sass', function() {
	return gulp.src('app/scss/**/*.scss') // Gets all files ending with .scss in app/scss
		.pipe(sass())
		.pipe(gulp.dest('app/css'))
		.pipe(browserSync.reload({
			stream: true
		}))
});
```

We're done with configuring Browser Sync. Now, we have to run both the `watch` and `browserSync` tasks at the same time for live-reloading to occur. 

It'll be cumbersome to open up two command line windows and run `gulp browserSync` and `gulp watch` separately, so let's get Gulp to run them together by telling the `watch` task that `browserSync` must be completed before `watch` is allowed to run. 

We can do so by adding a second argument to the `watch` task. The syntax is: 
    
```javascript
gulp.task('watch', ['array', 'of', 'tasks', 'to', 'complete','before', 'watch'], function (){
	// ...
})
```

And in this case we're adding the browserSync task. 
    
```javascript
gulp.task('watch', ['browserSync'], function (){
		gulp.watch('app/scss/**/*.scss', ['sass']); 
		// Other watchers
	})
```

We'll also want to make sure `sass` runs before `watch` so the CSS will already be the latest whenever we run a Gulp command. 
    
```javascript
gulp.task('watch', ['browserSync', 'sass'], function (){
	gulp.watch('app/scss/**/*.scss', ['sass']); 
	// Other watchers
});
```

Now, if you run `gulp watch` in the command line, Gulp should start both the `sass` and `browserSync` tasks concurrently. When both tasks are completed, `watch` will run. 

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/codevolve-assets/internal/courses/Gulp/23.png)

At the same time, a browser window that points to `app/index.html` would also pop up. If you change the `styles.scss` file, you'll see that the browser reloads automatically. 

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/codevolve-assets/internal/courses/Gulp/24.gif)

There's one more thing before we end this live-reloading section. Since we're already watching for `.scss` files to reload, why not go a step further and reload the browser if any HTML or JavaScript file gets saved? 

We can do so by adding two more watch processes, and calling the `browserSync.reload` function when a file gets saved: 
    
```javascript
gulp.task('watch', ['browserSync', 'sass'], function (){
	gulp.watch('app/scss/**/*.scss', ['sass']); 
	// Reloads the browser whenever HTML or JS files change
	gulp.watch('app/*.html', browserSync.reload); 
	gulp.watch('app/js/**/*.js', browserSync.reload); 
});
```

So far in this course we've taken care of three things: 

1. Spinning up a web server for development
2. Using the Sass preprocessor
3. Reloading the browser whenever a file is saved

Let's cover the part on optimizing assets in the next step. We'll start with optimizing CSS and JavaScript files. 

### Optimizing CSS and JavaScript Files

Developers have two tasks to perform when wthey try to optimize CSS and JavaScript files for production: **minification** and **concatenation**. 

One problem developers face when automating this process is that it's difficult to concatenate your scripts in the correct order. 

Say we have included 3 script tags in `index.html`.

```html
http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js"> src="">https://css-tricks.com/js/lib/a-library.js">
">https://css-tricks.com/js/lib/another-library.js">
">https://css-tricks.com/js/main.js">
```

These scripts are located in two different directories. It'll be difficult to concatenate them with traditional plugins like gulp-concatenate. 

Thankfully, there's a useful Gulp plugin, gulp-useref that solves this problem. 

Gulp-useref concatenates any number of CSS and JavaScript files into a single file by looking for a comment that starts with "". Its syntax is: 
    
```html   
... HTML Markup, list of script / link tags.
```

`` can either be `js`, `css`, or `remove`. It's best to set `type` to the type of file that you're trying to concatenate. If you set `type` to `remove`, Gulp will remove the entire build block without generating a file. 

`` here refers to the target path of the generated file.

We'll want the final JavaScript file to be generated in the `js` folder, as *main.min.js*. Hence, the markup would be: 

```html
">https://css-tricks.com/js/lib/a-library.js">
">https://css-tricks.com/js/lib/another-library.js">
">https://css-tricks.com/js/main.js">
```

Now let's configure the gulp-useref plugin in the gulpfile. We'll have to install the plugin and require it in the gulpfile.
    
```bash 
$ npm install gulp-useref --save-dev
```

```javascript
var useref = require('gulp-useref');
```

Setting up the `useref` task is similar to the other tasks we've done so far. Here's the code: 
    
```javascript    
gulp.task('useref', function(){
	return gulp.src('app/*.html')
		.pipe(useref())
		.pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))
});
```

Now if you run this `useref` task, Gulp will take run through the 3 script tags and concatenate them into `dist/js/main.min.js`. 

>Dev: Add image: https://cdn.css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/main-min.png

The file however, isn't minified right now. We'll have to use the [gulp-uglify][https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglify] plugin to help with minifying JavaScript files. We also need a second plugin called [gulp-if][https://github.com/robrich/gulp-if] to ensure that we only attempt to minify JavaScript files. 
    
```bash    
$ npm install gulp-uglify --save-dev 
```
    
```javascript
// Other requires...
var uglify = require('gulp-uglify');
var gulpIf = require('gulp-if');

gulp.task('useref', function(){
	return gulp.src('app/*.html')
		.pipe(useref())
		// Minifies only if it's a JavaScript file
		.pipe(gulpIf('*.js', uglify()))
		.pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))
});
```

Gulp should now automatically minify the `main.min.js` file whenever you run the `useref` task. 

One neat thing I've yet to reveal with Gulp-useref is that it automatically changes all the scripts within "" into one single JavaScript file that points to `js/main.min.js`. 

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/codevolve-assets/internal/courses/Gulp/25.png)

Wonderful, isn't it? 

We can use the same method to concatenate any CSS files (if you decided to add more than one) as well. We'll follow the same process and add a `build` comment. 
    
```HTML
">https://css-tricks.com/css/styles.css">
">https://css-tricks.com/css/another-stylesheet.css">
``` 

We can also minify the concatenated CSS file as well. We need to use a package called [gulp-cssnano][31] plugin to help us with minification.
    
```bash    
$ npm install gulp-cssnano
```

```javascript
var cssnano = require('gulp-cssnano');

gulp.task('useref', function(){
	return gulp.src('app/*.html')
		.pipe(useref())
		.pipe(gulpIf('*.js', uglify()))
		// Minifies only if it's a CSS file
		.pipe(gulpIf('*.css', cssnano()))
		.pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))
});
```

Now you'd get one optimized CSS file and one optimized JavaScript file whenever you run the `useref` task. 

Let's move on and optimize images next. 

### Optimizing Images

You've probably guessed it by now; we need to use **gulp-imagemin** to help us with optimizing images.
    
```bash    
$ npm install gulp-imagemin --save-dev
```

```javascript
var imagemin = require('gulp-imagemin');
```

We can minify `png`, `jpg`, `gif` and even `svg` with the help of gulp-imagemin. Let's create an `images` task for this optimization process. 
    
```javascript    
gulp.task('images', function(){
	return gulp.src('app/images/**/*.+(png|jpg|gif|svg)')
	.pipe(imagemin())
	.pipe(gulp.dest('dist/images'))
});
```

Since different file types can be optimized differently, you might want to add options to `imagemin` to customize how each file is optimized. 

For example, you can create interlaced GIFs by setting the `interlaced` option key to `true`. 
    
```javascript    
gulp.task('images', function(){
	return gulp.src('app/images/**/*.+(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg)')
	.pipe(imagemin({
			// Setting interlaced to true
			interlaced: true
		}))
	.pipe(gulp.dest('dist/images'))
});
```

You can play around with other options if you want to as well. 

Optimizing images however, is an extremely slow process that you'd not want to repeat unless necessary. To do so, we can use the [gulp-cache][https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cache] plugin.
    
```bash    
$ npm install gulp-cache --save-dev
```
   
```javascript
var cache = require('gulp-cache');

gulp.task('images', function(){
	return gulp.src('app/images/**/*.+(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg)')
	// Caching images that ran through imagemin
	.pipe(cache(imagemin({
			interlaced: true
		})))
	.pipe(gulp.dest('dist/images'))
});
```

We're almost done with the optimization process. There's one more folder that we need to transfer from the `app` directory into `dist`, the fonts directory.

### Copying Fonts to Dist

Since **font** files are already optimized, there's nothing more we need to do. All we have to do is to copy the fonts into **dist**.

We can copy files with Gulp simply by specifying the gulp.src and gulp.dest without any plugins.

```javascript
gulp.task('fonts', function() {
  return gulp.src('app/fonts/**/*')
  .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/fonts'))
})
```

Now Gulp will copy `fonts` from `app` to `dist` whenever you run gulp fonts.

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/codevolve-assets/internal/courses/Gulp/font-copy.png)

We have 6 different tasks in the gulpfile now, and each of them has to be called individually with the command line, which is kinda cumbersome so we want to tie everything together into one command.

Before we do that though, let's look at how to clean up generated files automatically.

### Cleaning Up Generated Files Automatically

Since we're generating files automatically, we'll want to make sure that files that are no longer used don't remain anywhere without us knowing. 

This process is called cleaning (or in simpler terms, deleting files). 

We'll have to use [del](https://www.npmjs.com/package/del) to help us with cleaning. 
    
```bash    
npm install del --save-dev
```
    
```javascript
var del = require('del');
```

The `del` function takes in an array of node globs which tells it what folders to delete. 

Setting it up with a Gulp task is almost like the first "hello" example we had. 
    
```javascript   
gulp.task('clean:dist', function() {
	return del.sync('dist');
})
```

Now Gulp will delete the *dist* folder for you whenever `gulp clean:dist` is run. 

We don't have to worry about deleting the *dist/images* folder because gulp-cache has already stored the caches of the images on your local system. 

To clear the caches off your local system, you can create a separate task that's named `cache:clear`

```javascript
gulp.task('cache:clear', function (callback) {  
return cache.clearAll(callback)  
})
```

Let's combine all our tasks together now! 

### Combining Gulp Tasks

Let's summarise what we've done. So far, we have created two distinct sets of Gulp tasks. 

The first set is for a development process, where we compiled Sass to CSS, watched for changes, and reloaded the browser accordingly. 

The second set is for an optimization process, where we ready all files for the production website. We optimized assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images in this process and copied fonts over from `app` to `dist`. 

We've already grouped the first set of tasks together into a simple workflow with the `gulp watch` command: 
    
```Javascript
gulp.task('watch', ['browserSync', 'sass'], function (){
	// ... watchers
})
```

The second set consists of tasks that we need to run to create the production website. This includes `clean:dist`, `sass`, `useref`, `images` and `fonts`. 

If we went by the same train of thought, we could create a `build` task to combine everything together. 
    
```Javascript    
gulp.task('build', [`clean`, `sass`, `useref`, `images`, `fonts`], function (){
	console.log('Building files');
})
```

Unfortunately, we wouldn't be able to write the `build` task this way because Gulp activates all tasks in the second argument simultaneously.

There's a possibility that `useref`, `images`, or even `fonts` gets completed before `clean` does, which means the entire `dist` folder gets deleted. 

So, to ensure that cleans get completed before the rest of the tasks, we need to use an extra plugin called [Run Sequence](https://www.npmjs.com/package/run-sequence).    

```bash
$ npm install run-sequence --save-dev
```

Here's the syntax of a task sequence with run sequence: 
    
```javascript    
var runSequence = require('run-sequence');

gulp.task('task-name', function(callback) {
	runSequence('task-one', 'task-two', 'task-three', callback);
});
```

When `task-name` is called, Gulp will run `task-one` first. When `task-one` finishes, Gulp will automatically start `task-two`. Finally, when `task-two` is complete, Gulp will run `task-three`. 

Run Sequence also allows you to run tasks simultaneously if you place them in an array: 
    
```javascript
gulp.task('task-name', function(callback) {
	runSequence('task-one', ['tasks','two','run','in','parallel'], 'task-three', callback);
});
```

In this case, Gulp first runs `task-one`. When `task-one` is completed, Gulp runs every task in the second argument simultaneously. All tasks in this second argument must be completed before `task-three` is run.

So we can now create a task that ensures that `clean:dist` runs first, followed by all the other tasks:

```javascript
gulp.task('build', function (callback) {
	runSequence('clean:dist', 
		['sass', 'useref', 'images', 'fonts'],
		callback
	)
})
```

To make things consistent, we can also build the same sequence with the first group. Let's use `default` as the task name this time: 
    
```javascript    
gulp.task('default', function (callback) {
	runSequence(['sass','browserSync', 'watch'],
		callback
	)
})
```

Why `default`? Because when you have a task named `default`, you can run it simply by typing the `gulp` command, which saves some keystrokes.

Finally, here's a [github repo](https://github.com/zellwk/gulp-starter-csstricks) for all the work we've done!

### Wrapping It Up

We've gone through the absolute basics of Gulp and created a workflow that's able to compile Sass into CSS while watching HTML and JS files for changes at the same time. We can run this task with the `gulp` command in the command line. 

We've also built a second task, `build`, that creates a `dist` folder for the production website. We compiled Sass into CSS, optimized all our assets, and copied the necessary folders into the `dist` folder. To run this task, we just have to type `gulp build` into the command line. 

Lastly, we have a `clean` task that clears away from the generated `dist` folder any image caches that are created, allowing us to remove any old files that were inadvertently kept in `dist`. 

We've created a robust workflow so far that's capable enough for most web developers. Congratulations!
