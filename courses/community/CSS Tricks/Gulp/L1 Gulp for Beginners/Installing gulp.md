Let's begin by installing gulp onto your computer. Type this into the terminal on the right:

```
$ npm install gulp -g
```

The `npm install` command  used here is a command that uses **Node Package Manager** (npm) to install gulp for this lesson. 

The `-g` flag in this command tells npm to install gulp globally onto your computer, which allows you to use the `gulp` command anywhere in the lesson. 

Now that you have gulp installed, let's make a project that uses it!
