Tools like gulp are often referred to as **build tools** because they are tools for running the tasks for building a website. The two most popular build tools out there right now are gulp and **Grunt**. There are others of course,  like **Broccoli** which focuses on asset compilation, and is one of the most common build tool tasks. 

The main difference is how you configure a workflow with them. Gulp configurations tend to be much shorter and simpler when compared with grunt. Gulp also tends to run faster. 

By the end of this course, you'll have a workflow that does the tasks we outlined in the first step:

* Spins up a web server
* Compiles Sass to CSS
* Refreshes the browser automatically whenever you save a file
* Optimizes all assets (CSS, JS, fonts, and images) for production

You'll also learn how to **chain** together different tasks into simple commands that are easy to understand and execute.
