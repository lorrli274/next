The Social Security administration has this neat data by year of what names are most popular for babies born that year in the USA. Check it out: [Social Security baby names](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/babynames/).

The files for this exercise are in the *babynames html files/* directory. The files *baby1990.html* and *baby1992.html* contain raw HTML, similar to what you get visiting the above social security site. Take a look at the HTML and think about how you might scrape the data out of it.

Here's what the HTML looks like in the baby.html files:

```html
...
<h3 align="center">Popularity in 1990</h3>
....
<tr align="right"><td>1</td><td>Michael</td><td>Jessica</td>
<tr align="right"><td>2</td><td>Christopher</td><td>Ashley</td>
<tr align="right"><td>3</td><td>Matthew</td><td>Brittany</td>
...
```
