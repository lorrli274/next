The Social Security administration has this neat data by year of what names are most popular for babies born that year in the USA. See [social security baby names](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/babynames/).

The files for this exercise are in the "babynames html files" directory. The files baby1990.html baby1992.html ... contain raw html, similar to what you get visiting the above social security site. Take a look at the html and think about how you might scrape the data out of it.


Here's what the html looks like in the baby.html files:
```html
...
<h3 align="center">Popularity in 1990</h3>
....
<tr align="right"><td>1</td><td>Michael</td><td>Jessica</td>
<tr align="right"><td>2</td><td>Christopher</td><td>Ashley</td>
<tr align="right"><td>3</td><td>Matthew</td><td>Brittany</td>
...
```
