The Social Security administration has this neat data by year of what names are most popular for babies born that year in the USA. See [social security baby names](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/babynames/).

The files for this exercise are in the "babynames" directory inside google-python-exercises (download the [google-python-exercises.zip](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/google-python-exercises.zip) if you have not already, see [Set Up](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/set-up) for details). Add your code in babynames.py. The files baby1990.html baby1992.html ... contain raw html, similar to what you get visiting the above social security site. Take a look at the html and think about how you might scrape the data out of it.
