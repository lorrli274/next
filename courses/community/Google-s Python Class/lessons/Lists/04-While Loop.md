Python also has the standard **while-loop**, and the **break*** and **continue** statements work as in C++ and Java, altering the course of the innermost loop. The above **for/in loops** solves the common case of iterating over every element in a list, but the while loop gives you total control over the index numbers. Here's a while loop which accesses every 3rd element in a list:
    
```python    
## Access every 3rd element in a list
i = 0
while i 
```
