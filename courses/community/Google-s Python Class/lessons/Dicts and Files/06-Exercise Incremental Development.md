Building a Python program, don't write the whole thing in one step. Instead identify just a first milestone, e.g. "well the first step is to extract the list of words." Write the code to get to that milestone, and just print your data structures at that point, and then you can do a `sys.exit(0)` so the program does not run ahead into its not-done parts. 

Once the milestone code is working, you can work on code for the next milestone. Being able to look at the printout of your variables at one state can help you think about how you need to transform those variables to get to the next state. Python is very quick with this pattern, allowing you to make a little change and run the program to see how it works. Take advantage of that quick turnaround to build your program in little steps.
