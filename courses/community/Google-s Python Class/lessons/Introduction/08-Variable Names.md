Since Python **variables** don't have any type spelled out in the source code, it's extra helpful to give meaningful names to your variables to remind yourself of what's going on. So use `name` if it's a single name, and `names` if it's a list of names, and `tuples` if it's a list of tuples. Many basic Python errors result from forgetting what type of value is in each variable, so use your variable names to help keep things straight.

As far as actual naming goes, some languages prefer \_underscored\_ parts for variable names made up of more than one word, but other languages prefer camelCasing. In general, Python [prefers](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-names) the underscore method, but also guides developers to defer to camelCasing if integrating into existing Python code that already uses that style.

Keywords like `print` and `while` cannot be used as variable names. If you try, you'll get a syntax error. However, be careful not to use built-ins as variable names. For example, while 'str' and 'list' may seem like good names, you'd be overriding those system variables. Built-ins are not keywords and thus, are susceptible to inadvertent use by new Python developers.
