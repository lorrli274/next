Regular expression patterns pack a lot of meaning into just a few characters , but they are so dense, you can spend a lot of time debugging your patterns. Set up your runtime so you can run a pattern and print what it matches easily, for example by running it on a small test text and printing the result of findall(). If the pattern matches nothing, try weakening the pattern, removing parts of it so you get too many matches. When it's matching nothing, you can't make any progress since there's nothing concrete to look at. Once it's matching too much, then you can work on tightening it up incrementally to hit just what you want.
