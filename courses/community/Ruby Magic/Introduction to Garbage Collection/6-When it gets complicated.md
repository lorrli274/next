Without getting into complex examples, trust me when I say the Garbage Collector's job is really hard. This also explains why GC can cause overhead and problems in your production environment. It needs to have a very detailed understanding of what's happening in your program to properly clear memory, which takes quite a few CPU cycles to get right. But hey, it beats cleaning up after yourself!
