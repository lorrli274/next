After all this you might ask, which of these three methods should I use?

* For most apps, threading makes sense. It's the simplest approach to work with.
* If you run highly concurrent apps with long-running streams, event loops allow you to scale.
* If you expect your processes to crash, go for good old multi-process, as it's the most robust approach.

This concludes our lessons on concurrency, as well as the Ruby Magic course. Great work! Thanks for taking this course, we hope you learned something along the way!
