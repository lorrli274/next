Escaping characters in Ruby, and many other programming languages, can be quite confusing. Suddenly certain combinations of characters get a different meaning inside a double quoted string compared to being used inside a single quoted string.

Hopefully this lesson has helped you with understanding how to properly escape characters and sequences in Ruby. The difference between a double and single quoted string is key here.

The string "magic" of escape sequences and interpolation only really works in double quoted strings, but not in single quoted strings.

There are also other ways of escaping code in Ruby itself. The percent notation helps us with avoiding to escape certain characters all the time, in strings and regular expressions.

But the backslash is also very useful for writing multi-line strings and continuing a line of Ruby code on the next line and is used a lot to keep code clean and readable.
