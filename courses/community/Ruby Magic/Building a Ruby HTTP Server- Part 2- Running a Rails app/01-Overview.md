In an earlier lesson we implemented a 30-line HTTP server in Ruby. Without having to write a lot of code, we were able to handle HTTP GET requests and serve a simple Rack application. This time, we'll take our home made server a bit further. When we're done, we'll have a web server that can serve Rails' famous fifteen minute blog that allows you to create, update and delete posts.
