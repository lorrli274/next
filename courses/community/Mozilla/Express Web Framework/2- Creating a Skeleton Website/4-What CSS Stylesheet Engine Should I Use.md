The Express Application Generator allows you to create a project that is configured to use the most common **CSS stylesheet engines**: [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/).

Info> CSS has some limitations that make certain tasks difficult. CSS stylesheet engines allow you to use more powerful syntax for defining your CSS, and then compile the definition into plain-old CSS for browsers to use.

As with templating engines, you should use the stylesheet engine that will allow your team to be most productive. For this project we'll use the ordinary CSS (the default) as our CSS requirements are not sufficiently complicated to justify using anything else.
