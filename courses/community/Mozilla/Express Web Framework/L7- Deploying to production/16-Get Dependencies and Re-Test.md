Before we proceed, let's test the site again and make sure it wasn't affected by any of our changes. 

First we will need to fetch our **dependencies** (you will recall we didn't copy the *node_modules* folder into our git tree). You can do this by running the following command in your terminal at the root of the project:
    
```js    
npm install
```    

Now run the site (see Testing the routes for the relevant commands) and check that the site still behaves as you expect.
