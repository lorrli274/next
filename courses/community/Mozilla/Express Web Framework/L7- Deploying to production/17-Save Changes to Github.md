Next let's save all our changes to Github. In the terminal (whilst inside our repository), enter the following commands:
    
```js    
git add -A
git commit -m "Added files and changes required for deployment to heroku"
git push origin master
```

We should now be ready to start deploying _LocalLibrary_ on Heroku.
