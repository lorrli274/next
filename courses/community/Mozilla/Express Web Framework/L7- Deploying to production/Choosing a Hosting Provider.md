There are numerous hosting providers that are known to either actively support or work well with Node (and Express). These vendors provide different types of environments (IaaS, PaaS), and different levels of computing and network resources at different prices.

Info>There are a lot of hosting solutions, and their services and pricing can change over time. While we introduce a few options below, it is worth performing your own Internet search before selecting a hosting provider.

Some of the things to consider when choosing a host:

* How busy your site is likely to be and the cost of data and computing resources required to meet that demand.
* Level of support for scaling horizontally (adding more machines) and vertically (upgrading to more powerful machines) and the costs of doing so.
* Where the supplier has data centres, and hence where access is likely to be fastest.
* The host's historical uptime and downtime performance.
* Tools provided for managing the site â€” are they easy to use and are they secure (e.g. SFTP vs FTP).
* Inbuilt frameworks for monitoring your server.
* Known limitations. Some hosts will deliberately block certain services (e.g. email). Others offer only a certain number of hours of "live time" in some price tiers, or only offer a small amount of storage.
* Additional benefits. Some providers will offer free domain names and support for SSL certificates that you would otherwise have to pay for.
* Whether the "free" tier you're relying on expires over time, and whether the cost of migrating to a more expensive tier means you would have been better off using some other service in the first place!

The good news when you're starting out is that there are quite a few sites that provide computing environments for "free", albeit with some conditions. For example, Heroku provides a free but resource-limited PaaS environment "forever", while Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and the open source option PWS/Cloud Foundry provide free credit when you first join.

Many providers also have a "basic" tier that provides more useful levels of computing power and fewer limitations. Digital Ocean is an example of a popular hosting provider that offers a relatively inexpensive basic computing tier (in the $5 per month lower range at time of writing).

Info>Remember that price is not the only selection criterion. If your website is successful, it may turn out that scalability is the most important consideration.
