Open the */controllers/authorController.js* file and copy in the following code:

```js
var Author = require('../models/author');

// Display list of all Authors.
exports.author_list = function(req, res) {
		res.send('NOT IMPLEMENTED: Author list');
};

// Display detail page for a specific Author.
exports.author_detail = function(req, res) {
		res.send('NOT IMPLEMENTED: Author detail: ' + req.params.id);
};

// Display Author create form on GET.
exports.author_create_get = function(req, res) {
		res.send('NOT IMPLEMENTED: Author create GET');
};

// Handle Author create on POST.
exports.author_create_post = function(req, res) {
		res.send('NOT IMPLEMENTED: Author create POST');
};

// Display Author delete form on GET.
exports.author_delete_get = function(req, res) {
		res.send('NOT IMPLEMENTED: Author delete GET');
};

// Handle Author delete on POST.
exports.author_delete_post = function(req, res) {
		res.send('NOT IMPLEMENTED: Author delete POST');
};

// Display Author update form on GET.
exports.author_update_get = function(req, res) {
		res.send('NOT IMPLEMENTED: Author update GET');
};

// Handle Author update on POST.
exports.author_update_post = function(req, res) {
		res.send('NOT IMPLEMENTED: Author update POST');
};
```

The module first requires the model that we'll later be using to access and update our data. It then exports functions for each of the URLs we wish to handle (the create, update and delete operations use forms, and hence also have additional methods for handling form post requests â€” we'll discuss those methods in the "forms article" later on).

All the functions have the standard form of an _Express middleware function_, with arguments for the request, response, and the `next` function to be called if the method does not complete the request cycle (in all these cases it does!). The methods simply return a string indicating that the associated page has not yet been created. If a controller function is expected to receive path parameters, these are output in the message string (see `req.params.id` above).
