In this lesson we've learned a bit about databases and ORMs on Node/Express, and a lot about how Mongoose schema and models are defined. We then used this information to design and implement `Book`, `BookInstance`, `Author` and `Genre` models for the LocalLibrary website.

Last of all we tested our models by creating a number of instances (using a standalone script). In the next lesson we'll look at creating some pages to display these objects.
