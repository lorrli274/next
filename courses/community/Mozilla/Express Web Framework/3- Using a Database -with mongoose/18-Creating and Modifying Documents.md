To create a **record** you can define an instance of the model and then call `save()`. The examples below assume SomeModel is a model (with a single field "name") that we have created from our schema.
    
```js    
// Create an instance of model SomeModel
var awesome_instance = new SomeModel({ name: 'awesome' });

// Save the new model instance, passing a callback
awesome_instance.save(function (err) {
  if (err) return handleError(err);
  // saved!
});
```    

Creation of records (along with updates, deletes, and queries) are asynchronous operations â€” you supply a callback that is called when the operation completes. The API uses the error-first argument convention, so the first argument for the callback will always be an error value (or null). If the API returns some result, this will be provided as the second argument.

You can also use `create()` to define the model instance at the same time as you save it. The callback will return an error for the first argument and the newly-created model instance for the second argument.
    
```js    
SomeModel.create({ name: 'also_awesome' }, function (err, awesome_instance) {
  if (err) return handleError(err);
  // saved!
});
```

Every model has an associated connection (this will be the default connection when you use `mongoose.model()`). You create a new connection and call `.model()` on it to create the documents on a different database.

You can access the fields in this new record using the dot syntax, and change the values. You have to call `save()` or `update()` to store modified values back to the database.
    
```js    
// Access model field values using dot notation
console.log(awesome_instance.name); //should log 'also_awesome'

// Change record by modifying the fields, then calling save().
awesome_instance.name="New cool name";
awesome_instance.save(function (err) {
   if (err) return handleError(err); // saved!
   });
```
