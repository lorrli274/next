A schema can also have **instance** methods, **static** methods, and **query helpers**. The instance and static methods are similar, but with the obvious difference that an instance method is associated with a particular record and has access to the current object. Query helpers allow you to extend mongoose's chainable query builder API (for example, allowing you to add a query "byName" in addition to the `find()`, `findOne()` and `findById()` methods).
