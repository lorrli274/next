Copy the `Author` schema code shown below and paste it into your *./models/Author.js* file. The scheme defines an author has having `String` SchemaTypes for the first and family names, that are required and have a maximum of 100 characters, and `Date` fields for the date of birth and death.
    
 ```js   
var mongoose = require('mongoose');

var Schema = mongoose.Schema;

var AuthorSchema = new Schema(
  {
    first_name: {type: String, required: true, max: 100},
    family_name: {type: String, required: true, max: 100},
    date_of_birth: {type: Date},
    date_of_death: {type: Date},
  }
);

**// Virtual for author's full name
AuthorSchema
.virtual('name')
.get(function () {
  return this.family_name + ', ' + this.first_name;
});**

// Virtual for author's URL
AuthorSchema
.virtual('url')
.get(function () {
  return '/catalog/author/' + this._id;
});

//Export model
module.exports = mongoose.model('Author', AuthorSchema);
```    
    

We've also declared a virtual for the AuthorSchema named "url" that returns the absolute URL required to get a particular instance of the model â€” we'll use the property in our templates whenever we need to get a link to a particular author.

Declaring our URLs as a virtual in the schema is a good idea because then the URL for an item only ever needs to be changed in one place.  
At this point a link using this URL wouldn't work, because we haven't got any routes handling code for individual model instances. We'll set those up in a later article!

At the end of the module we export the model.
