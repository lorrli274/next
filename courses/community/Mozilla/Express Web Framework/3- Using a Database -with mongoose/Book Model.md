Copy the `Book` schema code shown below and paste it into your **./models/Book.js** file. Most of this is similar to the author model â€” we've declared a schema with a number of string fields and a virtual for getting the URL of specific book records, and we've exported the model.
    
```js    
var mongoose = require('mongoose');

var Schema = mongoose.Schema;

var BookSchema = new Schema(
  {
    title: {type: String, required: true},
  **  author: {type: Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'Author', required: true},**
    summary: {type: String, required: true},
    isbn: {type: String, required: true},
  **  genre: [{type: Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'Genre'}]**
  }
);

// Virtual for book's URL
BookSchema
.virtual('url')
.get(function () {
  return '/catalog/book/' + this._id;
});

//Export model
module.exports = mongoose.model('Book', BookSchema);
```    

The main difference here is that we've created two references to other models:

* author is a reference to a single `Author` model object, and is required.
* genre is a reference to an array of `Genre` model objects. We haven't declared this object yet!
