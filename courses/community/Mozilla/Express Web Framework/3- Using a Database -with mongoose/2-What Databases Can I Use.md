Express apps can use any database supported by Node (Express itself doesn't define any specific additional behaviour/requirements for database management). There are many popular options, including **PostgreSQ**, **MySQL**, **Redis**, **SQLite**, and **MongoDB**.

When choosing a database, you should consider things like time-to-productivity/learning curve, performance, ease of replication/backup, cost, community support, etc. While there is no single "best" database, almost any of the popular solutions should be more than acceptable for a small-to-medium-sized site like our Local Library.
