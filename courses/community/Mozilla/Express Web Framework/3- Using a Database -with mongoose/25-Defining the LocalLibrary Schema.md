We will define a separate module for each model, as discussed above. Start by creating a folder for our models in the project root (**/models**) and then create separate files for each of the models:
    
```js    
/express-locallibrary-tutorial  //the project root
  **/models**
    **author.js**
    **book.js**
    **bookinstance.js**
    **genre.js**
```
