There are two approaches for interacting with a database: 

* Using the databases' **native query** language (e.g. **SQL**)
* Using an **Object Data Model** ("**ODM**") / **Object Relational Model** ("**ORM**"). An ODM/ORM represents the website's data as JavaScript objects, which are then mapped to the underlying database. Some ORMs are tied to a specific database, while others provide a database-agnostic backend.

The very best performance can be gained by using SQL, or whatever query language is supported by the database. ODM's are often slower because they use translation code to map between objects and the database format, which may not use the most efficient database queries (this is particularly true if the ODM supports different database backends, and must make greater compromises in terms of what database features are supported).

The benefit of using an ORM is that programmers can continue to think in terms of JavaScript objects rather than database semantics â€” this is particularly true if you need to work with different databases (on either the same or different websites). They also provide an obvious place to perform validation and checking of data.

info> Using ODM/ORMs often results in lower costs for development and maintenance! Unless you're very familiar with the native query language or performance is paramount, you should strongly consider using an ODM.
