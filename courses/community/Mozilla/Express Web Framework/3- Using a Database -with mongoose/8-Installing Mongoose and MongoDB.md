This section provides an overview of how to connect Mongoose to a MongoDB database, how to define a schema and a model, and how to make basic queries.

Mongoose is installed in your project (*Package.json*) like any other dependency â€” using NPM. To install it, use the following command inside your project folder:
    
```js    
npm install mongoose
```

Installing Mongoose adds all its dependencies, including the MongoDB database driver, but it does not install MongoDB itself. If you want to install a MongoDB server then you can download installers from here for various operating systems and install it locally. You can also use cloud-based MongoDB instances.

For this coura we'll be using the mLab cloud-based database as a service sandbox tier to provide the database. This is suitable for development, and makes sense for the tutorial because it makes "installation" operating system independent (database-as-a-service is also one approach you might well use for your production database).
