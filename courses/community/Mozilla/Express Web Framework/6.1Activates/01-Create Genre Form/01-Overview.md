This activity shows you how to define a page to create Genre objects (this is a good place to start because the Genre has only one field, its name, and no dependencies). Like any other pages, we need to set up routes, controllers, and views.

As you work through your project, mark each interactive instruction as complete once you have satisfied the requirements. This will run a series of automated tests against your work to ensure you've completed the instructions successfully.
