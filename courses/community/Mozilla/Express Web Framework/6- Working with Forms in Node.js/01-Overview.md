An **HTML Form** is a group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page that can be used to collect information from users for submission to a server. Forms are a flexible mechanism for collecting user input because there are suitable form inputs available for entering many different types of dataâ€”text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers, etc. Forms are also a relatively secure way of sharing data with the server, as they allow us to send data in `POST` requests with CSRF protection.

Working with forms can be complicated! Developers need to:
* Write HTML for the form
* Validate and properly sanitize entered data on the server (and possibly also in the browser)
* Repost the form with error messages to inform users of any invalid fields
* Handle the data when it has successfully been submitted
* And finally, respond to the user in some way to indicate success

In this course you'll learn how the above operations may be performed in the **Express** framework. You'll extend a website developed to support the local library to allow users to create, edit and delete items.
