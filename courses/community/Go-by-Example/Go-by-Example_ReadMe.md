## ReadMe

### GO by Example

Course has been created on Codevolve under "GO by Example"

### Files

1. Lessons will need to be divided into instructions and code files

   1. `##-title.txt` for instructions

      `01-Hello-World.txt`

      This only needs to increment if there is more than one set of instructions per example. 

      So each folder will have at least one instruction file listed as `01-title.txt`

   2. `title.go` for code files (these should already be named in the instructions)

      `HelloWorld.go`

2. Each folder per lesson will be title `##-title`

   `01-Hello-World`

3. Each file will need to be put in its own folder in the GitHub repo @ `Codevolve/next/courses/community/GO-by-Example`

4. There will not be a solution file or directory for this project, instead the student appears to be given the solution code as a starting point. 

Now both instructions and source code files will be accessbile via GitHub sync to Codevolve.
