## Go by Example: Hello World
Our first program will print the classic “hello world” message. Here’s the full source code
package main:
```go
import "fmt"
func main() {
    fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```
To run the program, put the code in * hello-world.go * and use ``` go run ```.
```go
$ go run hello-world.go
hello world
```
Sometimes we’ll want to build our programs into binaries. We can do this using ``` go buildc```.
```go
$ go build hello-world.go
$ ls
hello-world	hello-world.go
```
We can then execute the built binary directly.
```go
$ ./hello-world
hello world 
```
To run the program, put the code in * hello-world.go * and use go ``` run ``` or press the green "Run Code" button 
at the bottom of the editor.

Now that we can run and build basic Go programs, let’s learn more about the language.
Next example: * Values *.
