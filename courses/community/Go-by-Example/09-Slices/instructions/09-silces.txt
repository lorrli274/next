## Go by Example: Slices
``` Slices ``` are a key data type in Go, giving a more powerful interface to sequences than ``` arrays ```.
```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
```
Unlike ``` arrays ```,``` slices ``` are typed only by the elements they contain (not the number of elements). To create an empty slice with 
non-zero length, use the builtin make. 
Here we make a slice of strings of length 3 (initially zero-valued).
    s := make([]string, 3)
    fmt.Println("emp:", s)
