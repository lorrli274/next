## Go by Example: Methods
Go supports ** methods ** defined on struct types.
```go
type rect struct {
    width, height int
}
```
This ``` area ``` method has a receiver type of ``` *rect ```.
```go
func (r *rect) area() int {
    return r.width * r.height
}
```
Methods can be defined for either pointer or value receiver types. Here’s an example of a value receiver.
```go
func (r rect) perim() int {
    return 2*r.width + 2*r.height
}
```
Here we ** call ** the 2 methods defined for our struct.
```go
    r := rect{width: 10, height: 5}
    fmt.Println("area: ", r.area())
    fmt.Println("perim:", r.perim())
```
Go automatically handles conversion between values and pointers for method calls.
You may want to use a pointer receiver type to avoid copying on method calls or to allow the method to mutate the receiving struct.
```go
    rp := &r
    fmt.Println("area: ", rp.area())
    fmt.Println("perim:", rp.perim())
```
Below is an example of the program output:
```go
$ go run methods.go 
area:  50
perim: 30
area:  50
perim: 30
```
Next we’ll look at Go’s mechanism for grouping and naming related sets of methods: Interfaces
Next example: ** Interfaces **.
