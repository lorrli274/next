## Go by Example: Time

Go offers extensive support for times and durations; here are some examples.


We’ll start by getting the current time.
```go
    p := fmt.Println
    
    now := time.Now()
    p(now)
```


You can build a `time` struct by providing the year, month, day, etc. Times are always associated with a `Location`, i.e. time zone.
```go  
    then := time.Date(
        2009, 11, 17, 20, 34, 58, 651387237, time.UTC)
    p(then)
```


You can extract the various components of the time value as expected.
```go    
    p(then.Year())
    p(then.Month())
    p(then.Day())
    p(then.Hour())
    p(then.Minute())
    p(then.Second())
    p(then.Nanosecond())
    p(then.Location())
```


The Monday-Sunday `Weekday` is also available.
```go    
    p(then.Weekday())
```


These methods compare two times, testing if the first occurs before, after, or at the same time as the second, respectively.
```go
    p(then.Before(now))
    p(then.After(now))
    p(then.Equal(now))
```


The `Sub` methods returns a `Duration` representing the interval between two times.
```go
    diff := now.Sub(then)
    p(diff)
```


We can compute the length of the duration in various units.
```go
    p(diff.Hours())
    p(diff.Minutes())
    p(diff.Seconds())
    p(diff.Nanoseconds())
```


You can use `Add` to advance a time by a given duration, or with a `-` to move backwards by a duration.
```go
    p(then.Add(diff))
    p(then.Add(-diff))
```
Below is an example of the program output:
```go
$ go run time.go

2009-11-17 20:34:58.651387237 +0000 UTC

2006-12-05 01:19:43.509120474 +0000 UTC
```

Next we’ll look at the related idea of time relative to the Unix epoch.

Next example: *Epoch*.
