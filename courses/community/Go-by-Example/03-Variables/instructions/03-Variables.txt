### Go by Example: Variables
In Go, variables are explicitly declared and used by the compiler to e.g. check type-correctness of function calls.

``` var ``` declares 1 or more variables.
You can declare multiple variables at once.
Go will infer the type of initialized variables.
Variables declared without a corresponding initialization are ** zero-valued **. For example, the zero value for an ``` int ``` is ** 0 **.

The ```:= ``` syntax is shorthand for declaring and initializing a variable, e.g. for ``` var f string = "short" ``` in this case.
