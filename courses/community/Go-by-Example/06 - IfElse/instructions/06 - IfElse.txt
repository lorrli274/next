## Go by Example: If/Else
Branching with ``` if ``` and ``` else ``` in Go is straight-forward.
Here’s a basic example
You can have an ``` if ```statement without an ``` else ```.
A statement can precede conditionals; any variables declared in this statement are available in all branches.
Note that you don’t need parentheses around conditions in Go, but that the braces are required.
```
$ go run if-else.go 
7 is odd
8 is divisible by 4
9 has 1 digit
```
There is no ternary if in Go, so you’ll need to use a full if statement even for basic conditions.
