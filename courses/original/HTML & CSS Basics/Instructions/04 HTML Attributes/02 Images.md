Images work a little different than the other tags you've tried so far. Since there is no text involved, image elements don't need a closing tag!

Similar to how links need the href attribute, `img` tags need a `src` ("source") attribute that references the location of the image to load. So an `img` tag looks like this:
```html
<img src="myImage.png">
```
You can either use a direct link to an image, or link to one online with a URL. For this lesson, we've provided an image named "codey.png".
