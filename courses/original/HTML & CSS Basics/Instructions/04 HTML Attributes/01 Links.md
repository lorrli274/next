**Hyperlinks** (links), are text or images you can click on a webpage that jump you to another page. Anytime you use a website, you are using links to get from one page to the next. You can add a link by using the anchor (`a`) tag.

In order to make your link work, you need to add an **attribute** to your `a` tag. An attribute is extra information added to the inside of the opening tag to make it work properly. They follow this general pattern:

```html
<tag attribute="attribute value"></tag>```

For links, you need to add where the link goes using the `href` (hypertext reference) attribute. All together your link should look something like this:
```html
<a href="myFile.html">My Other Page</a>
```

Let's try linking to the secondFile.html to see links in action!
