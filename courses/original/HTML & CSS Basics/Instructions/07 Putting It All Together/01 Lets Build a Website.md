You've completed all the tutorials, now it's time to practice what you've learned. This is an open-ended project, so you can build whatever you want!

If you need some help getting started, try building a website about yourself! Here are some ideas for what to include:

* A title using the `h1` tag with your name
* A section title using the `h2` tag called "Favorite Quote"
* Your favorite quote using the `blockquote` tag
* An `h2` section titled "About Me"
* A paragraph using the `p` tag with some information about yourself
* A list using the `ol` or `ul` tag of your top 3 favorite movies

You can chose to color elements however you want using CSS between the `<style></style>` tags on the page.

If at any point you get stuck, feel free to ask Codey for some help. Try using the command `/explain ol` (don't forget the slash!) to get an explanation of what the tags do!
