Think of headers in terms of the contents of a book. The title of the book would be the main header, which is an `h1` tag. The chapters of the book would be a second level down from that, or `h2`.

There are six levels of header tags you can use: `h1` all the way down to `h6`.

Let's try adding this code to our website to make our first header:
```html
<h1>I love HTML!</h1>
```

Remember, everything you want shown on your webpage should go between the opening `<body>` and closing `</body>` tags!
