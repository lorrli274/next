Being able to add plain text to your webpage is a great skill to have. Now it's time to add some style to it!

You can make any text **bold** and *italicized* by using the `strong` and `em` tags. The "em" here stands for "emphasized".

Try adding paragraphs and different headers to your page and seeing which ones you can add bold or italics to. You should notice the headers don't get bold when you add the `strong` tag. This is because they are already bold to begin with!
