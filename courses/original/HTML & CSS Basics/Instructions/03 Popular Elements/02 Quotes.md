There are two types of quote tags in HTML, **quote** and **blockquote**.

The quote tag (`q`) can be used to add quotes to paragraphs on your website. You'll also notice it adds the quotation marks for you!

The `blockquote` tag is kind of like the quote tag, but it adds some fancy styles to your quoted text! This goes on text that is not inside a paragraph since it's meant for longer quotes.
