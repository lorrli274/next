There are two types of lists in HTML, **ordered lists** and **unordered lists**.

An ordered list (the `<ol>` tag) is a series of items that are numbered, and an unordered list (the `<ul>` tag) has bullet points instead of numbers.

To create a list, you need to specify what type of list you want by using either `<ol>` or `<ul>`. Then inside of the list, you add each **list item** using the `<li>` tag. So the structure would look something like this:

```html
<ul>
  <li>List Item 1</li>
  <li>List Item 2</li>
</ul>
```
