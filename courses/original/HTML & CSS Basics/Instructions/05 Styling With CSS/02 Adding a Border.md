The **border** property is a bit tricky. It requires multiple values: **size**, **type**, and **color**.

The size can be added in pixel size by doing something similar to `2px`. To understand the size of a pixel, look really close at your computer screen. You should see millions of tiny squares of different colors making up the display. Those squares are the pixels!

There are a few types to pick from: `dotted`, `solid`, and `dashed`are a few options.

Lastly, color is the color of the border.

So when you put it all together, you might get:
```css
border: 2px solid blue;
```
