Next we need to add **elements** to the file. Do you want large text? Lists of items? A paragraph? All of those are different elements that can be added with **tags**.

Elements are things you want to add to your page (a paragraph of text for example), but tags are the actual code you write to let the browser know what element you want.

Most elements require an opening and closing tag. `<p>` is the open tag for a paragraph, and `</p>` is the close tag. Do you see the difference? The close tag has a slash before the letter.

The first element we're going to need is the HTML element which is where all the HTML of your file goes. You can add that by opening it with `<html>` and closing it with `</html>`.

Then we need the `<body>` element. The `<body>` is where you add all the elements that people see when they visit your website. This gets added *inside* the html tag like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
The lines inside each tag should be indented 2 spaces *more* than the tag it is inside. This is why the `body` tags each have 2 spaces before them.

Let's give it a try!
