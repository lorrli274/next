There is a special line of code you can add to your HTML called a **comment**.  Comments are used as notes to yourself. They can be placed anywhere in your HTML and look like this:

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
```

Anything between `<!--` and `-->` won't get shown in your website. It's left as a message to the people reading and editing the HTML to let them know something about the code.

Let's add "I love coding!" inside a comment in `<body>` and notice that it does not show up in your website on the right. This is because the comment is ignored when the website is being built.
