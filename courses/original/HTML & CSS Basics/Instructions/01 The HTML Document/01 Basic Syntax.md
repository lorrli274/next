Program **syntax** is what programmers call the letters, numbers, and symbols used to write **code**. In this course we'll be using special HTML and CSS code to build webpages!

HTML and CSS code is placed inside a file, which your browser then displays as a webpage. In this course, your code file is the dark blue box located directly to the right of these instructions. Any code you place here will be used to build a webpage when you click the green **Build Website** button.

To the right of the code space is a preview of your website! At any time, you can click the gray arrow to view a larger version of this webpage. Since the steps in this lesson are focused on setting up your HTML file, nothing will be shown in your website preview until the next lesson.

For this lesson, we'll introduce you to HTML and how to set up your HTML document. Click **Next Step** to get started!
