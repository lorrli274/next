Git begins with a **repository**. This is a collection of files itself, stored in a `.git` directory alongside your files.

A Git repository contains all your code **commits** (or snapshots), which we'll cover soon. It also stores various data about the commits, such as tags or markers to specific points in your repositories history.

As you go through this course, you'll interact with your Git repository in various ways. To get started, we first need to create it.

A Git repository can be **initialized** using the `git init` command in any directory (as long as a git repository doesn't already exist there).
