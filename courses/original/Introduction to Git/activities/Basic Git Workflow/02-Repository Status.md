Now that you've created your repository, you can view information about it using the `git status` command. This command will output details on any files that are not yet saved to the repository, as well as some other useful information.

Recall that a Git repository is all about saving specific files. Each of these files can have one of four different statuses:

* **Untracked**: This is a file that is not yet monitored by the repository. As far as Git knows, this file doesn't exist.
* **Unmodified**: Git is monitoring this file, but it has not been modified since the last commit (remember, a commit is a snapshot of the repository).
* **Modified**: Git is also monitoring this status, but the file _has_ been edited since the last repository commit.
* **Staged**: Git is ready to snapshot the changes to this file in a new commit.

We'll cover each of these statuses in detail as we progress through the course.

For now, follow the instructions below!
