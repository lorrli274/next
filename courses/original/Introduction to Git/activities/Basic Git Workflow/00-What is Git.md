## Introduction

Have you ever wondered how expert developers and even entire companies keep track of all the code they write? In this course, you'll learn exactly that.

Git is a powerful tool used for what is called **version control**. Version control allows files to be saved at multiple points, locking in snapshots of what a file contains at a specific point in time. Software developers use version control software like Git to back up their files (often code), share them with others, and even to "time travel" through saved versions of their code if something goes amok.

Mastering Git will make it easier for you to manage your projects, collaborate with other developers, and even contribute to open source software. Check out the instructions below regarding how to use this course, and then let's get started!

## Instructions
On each step of this interactive course, you'll be presented with in-text instructions to complete. As you complete each task, and each instruction will automatically be checked off for you.

To get started, use `ls` to list the files in your current directory and complete the instruction below:
