In this open-ended project, you're provided a Git repository for a company called Johnson's Hardware. Nestled in the green mountains of Vermont, they're a small but high tech hardware and rental store that relies on version control to track their company's data.

They have created three CSV files to accomplish this:

* _products.csv_: The list of products Johnson's Hardware sells
* _customers.csv_: The customers Johnson's Hardware has sold to
* _sales.csv_: The sales that Johnson's Hardware has completed

Each time a sale is completed, a new record is added to the _sales.csv_ file. Currently a sales associate has added several new sales, but not saved them.

You can use this project to explore a full Git repository. Some things you may want to practice are:

* Comitting the existing changes
* Adding and deleting lines from each file
* Checking the status of the repository
* Viewing the file diffs

If you want to reset your repository to its original state, click the settings gear, then **Reset Project**.

Have fun exploring!

info> Each of these CSV files has an "ID" field, which is a unique number that corresponds to that the row in that field. This is similar to how a record might be stored in a database. If you haven't worked with databases, you don't need to worry about this right now.
