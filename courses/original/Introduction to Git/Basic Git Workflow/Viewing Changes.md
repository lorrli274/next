Once you have tracked files and committed them to your repo, you can view the specific changes made to files as you continue to edit them.

You can view changes that have not yet been `add`ed to be committed using the `git diff` command.

First, run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
cat numbers.py > lorem.txt
```

Whoops, you just overwrote your _lorem.txt_ file with _numbers.py_! That's not useful.

Complete the instruction below to survey the "damage".
