In this final lesson you learned new ways to write powerful queries to extract information from a database. Here's a quick review of what was covered:

* How to `JOIN` tables to relate their data and supercharge your queries

* How to aggregate data using `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, and `MIN`/`MAX`

* How to define the scope of a query using a `GROUP BY`

* How to filter data once it's been queried with a `HAVING` clause

* How `UNIONS` enable you to quickly append data in a query

In your next and final activity, you'll use each of these new concepts to help Johnson's Hardware answer important, business-critical questions from the database you've created.
