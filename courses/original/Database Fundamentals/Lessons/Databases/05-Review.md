In this lesson you learned:

* What a **database** is and what it's used for
* How to view the databases you have access too
* How to view the **schema** of a database
* How to **create** and **delete** a database

Throughout the rest of this course you'll be exposed to some of this again, especially how to work with a schema when making changes to it or extracting data from the database.

For now, congrats on taking your first step on learning about databases!
