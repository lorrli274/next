A database management system (DBMS) or **database** is a collection of tables, columns, and rows (or records). Together, these allow you to store various types of information and easily extract it when necessary.

When you interact with a website or app, the software is most likely backed by a database. Databases allow software developers to persist data so that when you return to the website your work, scores, and other interactions are still there.

In addition to persisting your data, databases allow for meaningful questions to be answered. This is accomplished using a **structured query language**, or **SQL**. For example, a developer may want to show you your average scores across all the games you played on their app, or the number of games, or all the games where you scored more than 300 points. Databases make that easy.

Many databases are **relational**, which means that the data in the database relates to one another. For example, a database could contain information for a construction company. It can track the company's projects, employees, and who is working on what project. A relational database is very structured, but there are also other less structured databases, such as graph databases.

The structure or **schema** of a database is extremely important. A messy schema will result in a difficult that is difficult to make changes to, store data in, and request data from. When building a database the majority of time is often spent diagramming the schema versus actually implementing it (which might only take a few minutes!).
