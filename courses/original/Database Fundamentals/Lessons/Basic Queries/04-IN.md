The **`IN`** clause can be used to check if a value is any number of different values. It's often used to reduce the number of `OR` conditions in a query.

For example, the following query uses an `IN` clause to find all the people with the last names _Hamill_, _Langworth_, and _Sauer_:

### Query
```sql
SELECT *
FROM   employees
WHERE  last_name IN ( 'Hamill', 'Langworth', 'Sauer' );
```

`IN` can be used with numeric data as well:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM   employees
WHERE  hourly_wage IN ( 33, 34 ); 
```
