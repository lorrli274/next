If you accidentally created a database or find that you no longer need a database, you may want to delete it. To do this, you can use the `DROP DATABASE` statement: 

```SQL
DROP DATABASE a_database;
```

Deleting a database is permanent, so you should be absolutely certain you're deleting the right one before you run your command!

DEV ins: Drop your *a_new_database* database.
