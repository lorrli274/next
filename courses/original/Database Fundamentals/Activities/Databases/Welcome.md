> DEV: Create / use Dave Johnson bot for this and all other activities

Welcome to your first activity! In this and the others in this course you'll help design, implement, maintain, and use a database for Johnson's Harware, a hardware and construction equipment rental company.

This hardware company has been around for decades, but to date they've done most of their delivery planning on pen and paper. They have a point-of-sale (POS) system for the inventory of their store, but managing their rental fleet has gotten out of hand as they've grown over the years.

To get started, here's a little background on Johnson's Hardware:

* They're a family run company founded over 20 years ago
* They serve both the local community and large contractors with a diverse offering of construction equiment rentals
* ... add more context

Their hope is that with the database you'll build, they'll be able to deliver more equiment faster than ever, leading to happier customers, an improved bottom line, and a snazzy high tech approach to rental equipment management.

Let's get started!
