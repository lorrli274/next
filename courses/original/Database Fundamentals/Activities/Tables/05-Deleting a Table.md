It's not possible to undo deleting a table, so make sure you're absolutely certain about your command before you run it!

Tables can be deleted using the `DROP` command:

```sql
DROP TABLE project_employees;
```

To prevent an error if the table does not exist, you can use the `IF EXISTS` condition:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS project_employees;
```

You cannot drop a table that is referenced by another table. The `employees` table is used by the `job_orders` and `project_employees` tables, so dropping it will generate an error:

```sql
DROP TABLE employees;
```
