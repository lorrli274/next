This lesson covered lots of information on tables, including:

* What a **table** is and what it's used for
* How tables relate to one another using **primary** and **foreign keys**
* How to view the structure of a table
* How to **design**, **create**, and **delete** a database

You'll use these skills in the next activity to help Johnson's Hardware to implement the first version of their database!
