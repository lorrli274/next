This lesson covered the basics of how to work with data in a database, specifically:

* How to add new records with **`INSERT`**
* How to update existing records with **`UPDATE`**
* How to delete records with **`DELETE`** and **`TRUNCATE TABLE`**

In the next activity you will use each of these to work with data in the database you created for Johnson's Hardware.
