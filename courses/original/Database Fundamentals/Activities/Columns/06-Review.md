A lot was covered in this lesson! Here's a summary:

* **Columns**: what are they, what are they used for?
* Different column **data types** and some common uses
* Database **normalization**'s requirements and how to address common issues
* Column **constraints** to ensure the database is always in the expected state
* **Adding**, **changing**, and **deleting** columns

That's quite a list! Next up, you'll get a chance to help Johnson's Hardware fix the issues they're having with their database caused by a lack of normalization.
