That was quite a lesson! As a refresher, here's what was covered:

* The basics of a database query using **`SELECT`**
* How to filter results using **`WHERE`**
* How to use the **`LIKE`**, **`IN`**, **`BETWEEN`**, and **`NOT`** operators
* What **`NULL`** is and how to work with it
* How to order results with **`ORDER BY`**
* How to limit results with **`LIMIT`**

You'll put all of this to use in the next activity, helping Johnson's Hardware write lots of queries to extract valuable information from the database you built for them.
