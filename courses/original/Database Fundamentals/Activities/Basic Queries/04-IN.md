The **`IN`** clause can be used to check if a value is any number of different values. It's often used to reduce the number of `OR` conditions in a query.

For example, the following query uses an `IN` clause to find all the people with the last names _Hamill_, _Langworth_, and _Sauer_:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM   employees
WHERE  last_name IN ( 'Hamill', 'Langworth', 'Sauer' );
```

This prevents you from having to write something like:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM   employees
WHERE  last_name = 'Hamill'
        OR last_name = 'Langworth'
        OR last_name = 'Sauer'; 
```

`IN` can be used with numeric data as well:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM   employees
WHERE  hourly_wage IN ( 33, 34 ); 
```

DEV: You suspect two employees, Ubaldo Predovic and Tess Hermiston, are putting in too few hours. Try to figure out how to pull their hours (along with their employee IDs) from the *project_employees* table. Hint: first, you will need to figure out what their employee IDs are. 

ANSWER: SELECT employee_id, hours FROM project_employees WHERE employee_id IN (12, 21);

info> To pull this data, you had to perform two separate queries. There is another way to do this in one query, using a `JOIN`. We will cover this next lesson and come back to this example!
