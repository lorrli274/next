## Conditional Statements and Loops

**Conditional statements** are statemtents that determine the flow of a program based on logic and conditions evaluated at run time. Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions and execute the appropriate block of code according to the certain parameters as the program runs. Conditional statements help make programs flexible in how they operate. These statements could be used to evaluate user input, evaluate program output, perform certain actions based on the results of algorithms. 

The figure below helps illustrate the flow of a program and where a conditional statement may be useful:

**Loops** are blocks of code that will run in a loop until a condition is met. Once that conditional is met, the loop breaks and control flow of the program continues. 

Conditional statements and loops come in a few different forms, each listed below. 

1. <u>`if` , `if / else`</u> statements
2.  <u>`do / while`</u> loop
3. <u>`switch`</u> statement
4. <u>`for`</u> loop
