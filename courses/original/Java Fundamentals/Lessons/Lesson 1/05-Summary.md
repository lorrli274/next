## Lesson 1: Basics of Java

### Summary

We covered a lot of ground so far. Let's go back and review some of what we learned. The next page contains an unfinished program with instructions for you to follow using the concepts that we have discussed in this chapter: 

1. Variables
2. Constants
3. Data Types
4. Strings
5. Document structure and Comments

If you are finding yourself unclear on one of the listed topics, go back and review that section before moving forward. The instructions are run against a series of tests to ensure that you have followed and implemented the desire solution correctly.
