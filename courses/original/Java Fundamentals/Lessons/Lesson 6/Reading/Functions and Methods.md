## Functions and Methods

Functions and methods are the building blocks of programs. They are absolutely essential in good, clean code, and make programs more modular and functional. For the most part, a function and a method are the same, the difference between the nomenclature depends on where the function or method lives and how it is called or accessed. A function is called by name, while a methond is called through an association with object. 

The successful implementation of functions are what can save a programmer enormous of time by making code reusable. The ability to write a block of code once, can call its functionality multiple times throughout a program is what makes encapsulating code in functions and methods so appealing. It may also help when debugging and troubleshooting code as methods and functions by nature are designed to perform one task, if that task fails, it is a clear indication of where something has gone wrong an implementation. 

Functions and methods are also easy to **Unit Test**. Unit tests are a means of ensuring that funcitons work and return proper values under a variety of circumstances to catch any edge cases that may break your program. The skill of writing thourough and expansive unit tests can be just as important as writing the functions and methods themselves and it is a great way to help validate your own code. 

This chapter will cover the following topics:
