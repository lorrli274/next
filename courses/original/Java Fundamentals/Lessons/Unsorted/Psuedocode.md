## Psuedocode

**Psuedocode** is a way a programer can scribble out some progamming logic without creating a workable solution. Essentially, psuedocode is a mix of a programming language and plain english. 

```java
public class myComplicatedProgram {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // grab system resources
        if(resources != null) {
            // distribute workload across multiple threads using
            delegation();
        }
    }
    
    private void delegation(/*workload*/) {
        // create a new asynchronous thread and distrubute the workload
    }
}
```

Psuedocode is a way a progreammer can outline the purpose of a program, a method, tasks, class, protocol, etc. from a high level instead of immediately attempting to program. Psuedocode helps programmers get a good sense of their options when they have different options available to them, such as the advantages that either a `for` loop or a `while` statement might offer at a specific point a a program. Some programmers also find it easier to write code using their pseudocode template rather than from scratch, pseudocode can often be turned into comments which also help readability for other programmers.
