## Collection

A `Collection` in Java is a class and framework (`java.util.Collection`) designed to unify ways of organizing **data structures** with commonly reused methods commonly found when working with data structures. A data structure in computer science is the means of organizing data, using common values, common methods, or relationship between the data. In Java, there are three common collection interfaces available, `List`, `Map`, `Set`. A `List` is similar to an array, indexed, may have duplicates, and can be ordered and unordered. A `Map` is a set of key-value pairs, a `Map` does not have an index and values are accessed through their key. A `Set` is a collection that contains no duplicate items, is not indexed, and contains no order.

This chapter will cover the basic functionality and use case of the following collection types:

1. `List`
2. `Map`
3. `Set`
