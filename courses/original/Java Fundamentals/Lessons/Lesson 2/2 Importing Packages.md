## Activity 3: Document Structure 

### Importing Packages

A package is a collection of related classes and code that you can import into your project. Packages can contain code and classes that you might find useful in your own program, without the need to write those classes and methods yourself. Standard libraries that are included with Java JRE and JDK distributions are called the **Java Class Library**. These include packages such as `java.lang` and `java.math` packages. 

There are an enourmous amount of third party packages available online repositories such as GitHub, that can offer more unique and tailored libraries to more specific needs. Throuought the software development lifecycle it is always a good idea to research these libraries as they can save hours and even days of internal software development. 

```java
import java.lang
import java.math
import java.io
import com.github.library.*
```



> One of the most important aspects of programming is staying organized. Keeping your project files organized, and your code organized can all help improve code readability, reusability, and cut time in development.
