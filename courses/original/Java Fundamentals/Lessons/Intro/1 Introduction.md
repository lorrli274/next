## Introduction

## Overview of the Java programming language

Why learn Java?  Java is one of the most popular modern programming languages and its implementation can be found in hundreds and thousands of different applications in every day use (ever use an Android phone?).  Java is incredibly prevalent in our modern technological age, it only makes sense that developers learn to read and write in the Java programming language as it is likely to be found in a variety of systems for many years to come. 

## What this course is

This course will teach the fundamentals of Java programming. As the course progresses there will be quizzes and assessments gauged to test your understanding of the conent covered in the lessons. The first few chapters will briefly go over some the of the basic concepts of Java and Object Oriented Programming, or *OOP*. If you have prior experience in other OOP languages and the concepts that make up this paradigm feel free to skip to ***Chapter 2: Basics of Java***. The later chapters delve into more core concepts, such as program flows, classes, and inheritence. Graphic user interfaces are not covered in this course but are in the **<u>Java GUI Concepts</u>** course and elements data structures are cover in **<u>Data Structures in Java Programming</u>** course.

## Interface

The course components contain a few different learning interfaces: 

1. Activity 
2. Snippets
3. Quizzes
4. Assessments
5. Projects

An **Activity** is the fundamental layout that you will encounter in this course. It consists of short explanations, examples, an interactive IDE, and a terminal. Activities will be used to practice coding concepts and follow along with the lesson. Some activities are reading only, this means that they have no coding IDE and are used to help explain new concepts, or concepts in more detail that would be practical in an activity with an IDE and terminal. 

A **Snippet** is similar to an activity except that it is not a complete IDE. Snippets are used to practice and see new concepts in action for the first time. They consist of a concept explanation along with a small snippet of code that can be run and used as practice. Snippets are used to introduce new coding concepts, and provide the reader with a way of seeing the output of the code, and the ability to manipulate the template to experiment. 

**Quizzes** are short multiple choice questions that are used to review the content of contained in a series of chapters. An example of a question would be: *What does OOP stand for*?

**Assessments** are used to gauge the coding capacity and skills of the reader at points throughout the course. Assessments provide the reader with a series of tasks to complete in the IDE and runs their implementation against a series of tests to ensure that they have implemented concepts correctly. A final grade at the end of the course will be given based on the accumulation of all assessment grades. 

**Projects** are programs that are ungraded, but give the reader an opportunity to practice and implement their new coding skills in a manner that they prefer to satisfy the requirements put forth in the instructions with the goal of fullfilling a real world application scenario.
