Create a program that takes prompts and accepts three values from the user. The program should prompt the user for input three times, once for an `int`, once for a `String` and once for a `char`.  
After all three values have been entered, output each value to the console preceeded by its data type or object.  

An example of the user input:
```java
20
"The Irish national flower is the clover"
a
```

and an example of the output: 
```java
int: 20
String: The Irish national flower is the clover
char: a
```
