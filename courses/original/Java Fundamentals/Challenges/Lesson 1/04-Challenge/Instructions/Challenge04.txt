A partially written program is in the file to the right. Finish writing the program by including:
1. A constant for the constant gravitation force of 6.67 * 10<sup>-11</sup>
2. Two variables named `mass1` and `mass2`
3. A constant to represent the value of the distance between to the two objects. 
4. A variable to hold the results of the forumula

The formula for F = G((m1 * m2)/r^2)

This program solves for the force of gravity on two objects.
