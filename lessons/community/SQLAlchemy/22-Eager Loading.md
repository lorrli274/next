Recall earlier that we illustrated a [lazy loading][85] operation, when we accessed the `User.addresses` collection of a `User` and SQL was emitted. If you want to reduce the number of queries (dramatically, in many cases), we can apply an eager load to the query operation. SQLAlchemy offers three types of eager loading, two of which are automatic, and a third which involves custom criterion. All three are usually invoked via functions known as query options which give additional instructions to the `[Query`][27] on how we would like various attributes to be loaded, via the `[Query.options()`][86] method.
