The `[Query`][27] is suitable for generating statements which can be used as subqueries. Suppose we wanted to load `User` objects along with a count of how many `Address` records each user has. The best way to generate SQL like this is to get the count of addresses grouped by user ids, and JOIN to the parent. In this case we use a LEFT OUTER JOIN so that we get rows back for those users who don't have any addresses, e.g.:
    
```    
SELECT users.*, adr_count.address_count FROM users LEFT OUTER JOIN
    (SELECT user_id, count(*) AS address_count
        FROM addresses GROUP BY user_id) AS adr_count
    ON users.id=adr_count.user_id
```

Using the `[Query`][27], we build a statement like this from the inside out. The `statement` accessor returns a SQL expression representing the statement generated by a particular `[Query`][27] \- this is an instance of a `[select()`][78] construct, which are described in [SQL Expression Language Tutorial][2]:
    
```    
>>> from sqlalchemy.sql import func
>>> stmt = session.query(Address.user_id, func.count('*').
...         label('address_count')).
...         group_by(Address.user_id).subquery()
```

The `func` keyword generates SQL functions, and the `subquery()` method on `[Query`][27] produces a SQL expression construct representing a SELECT statement embedded within an alias (it's actually shorthand for `query.statement.alias()`).

Once we have our statement, it behaves like a `[Table`][15] construct, such as the one we created for `users` at the start of this tutorial. The columns on the statement are accessible through an attribute called `c`:
    
```    
[sql][28]>>> for u, count in session.query(User, stmt.c.address_count).
...     outerjoin(stmt, User.id==stmt.c.user_id).order_by(User.id):
...     print(u, count)
 None
 None
 None
 None
