The [`contextlib.AbstractContextManager`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.AbstractContextManager) class has been added to provide an abstract base class for context managers. It provides a sensible default implementation for `__enter__()` which returns `self` and leaves `__exit__()` an abstract method. A matching class has been added to the [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#module-typing) module as [`typing.ContextManager`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.ContextManager).
