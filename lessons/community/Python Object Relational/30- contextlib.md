The `[contextlib.AbstractContextManager`][147] class has been added to provide an abstract base class for context managers. It provides a sensible default implementation for __enter__() which returns `self` and leaves __exit__() an abstract method. A matching class has been added to the `[typing`][12] module as `[typing.ContextManager`][148]. (Contributed by Brett Cannon in [bpo-25609][149].)
