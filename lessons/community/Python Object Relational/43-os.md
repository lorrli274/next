See the summary of [PEP 519][8] for details on how the `[os`][55] and `[os.path`][56] modules now support [path-like objects][9].

`[scandir()`][200] now supports `[bytes`][46] paths on Windows.

A new `[close()`][201] method allows explicitly closing a `[scandir()`][200] iterator. The `[scandir()`][200] iterator now supports the [context manager][202] protocol. If a `scandir()` iterator is neither exhausted nor explicitly closed a `[ResourceWarning`][15] will be emitted in its destructor. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [bpo-25994][203].)

On Linux, `[os.urandom()`][18] now blocks until the system urandom entropy pool is initialized to increase the security. See the **[PEP 524**][19] for the rationale.

The Linux `getrandom()` syscall (get random bytes) is now exposed as the new `[os.getrandom()`][204] function. (Contributed by Victor Stinner, part of the **[PEP 524**][19])
