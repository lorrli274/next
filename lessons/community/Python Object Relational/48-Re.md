Added support of modifier spans in regular expressions. Examples: `'(?i:p)ython'` matches `'python'` and `'Python'`, but not `'PYTHON'`; `'(?i)g(?-i:v)r'` matches `'GvR'` and `'gvr'`, but not `'GVR'`. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [bpo-433028][214].)

Match object groups can be accessed by `__getitem__`, which is equivalent to `group()`. So `mo['name']` is now equivalent to `mo.group('name')`. (Contributed by Eric Smith in [bpo-24454][215].)

`Match` objects now support `[index-like objects`][216] as group indices. (Contributed by Jeroen Demeyer and Xiang Zhang in [bpo-27177][217].)
