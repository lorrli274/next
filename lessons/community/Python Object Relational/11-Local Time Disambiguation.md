In most world locations, there have been and will be times when local clocks are moved back. In those times, intervals are introduced in which local clocks show the same time twice in the same day. In these situations, the information displayed on a local clock (or stored in a Python datetime instance) is insufficient to identify a particular moment in time.

**[PEP 495**][60] adds the new _fold_ attribute to instances of `[datetime.datetime`][61] and `[datetime.time`][62] classes to differentiate between two moments in time for which local times are the same:
    
    
    >>> u0 = datetime(2016, 11, 6, 4, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
    >>> for i in range(4):
    ...     u = u0 + i*HOUR
    ...     t = u.astimezone(Eastern)
    ...     print(u.time(), 'UTC =', t.time(), t.tzname(), t.fold)
    ...
    04:00:00 UTC = 00:00:00 EDT 0
    05:00:00 UTC = 01:00:00 EDT 0
    06:00:00 UTC = 01:00:00 EST 1
    07:00:00 UTC = 02:00:00 EST 0
    

The values of the `[fold`][63] attribute have the value `0` for all instances except those that represent the second (chronologically) moment in time in an ambiguous case.

### PEP 529: Change Windows filesystem encoding to UTF-8

Representing filesystem paths is best performed with str (Unicode) rather than bytes. However, there are some situations where using bytes is sufficient and correct.

Prior to Python 3.6, data loss could result when using bytes paths on Windows. With this change, using bytes to represent paths is now supported on Windows, provided those bytes are encoded with the encoding returned by `[sys.getfilesystemencoding()`][64], which now defaults to `'utf-8'`.

Applications that do not use str to represent paths should use `[os.fsencode()`][53] and `[os.fsdecode()`][52] to ensure their bytes are correctly encoded. To revert to the previous behaviour, set `[PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSFSENCODING`][65] or call `[sys._enablelegacywindowsfsencoding()`][66].

See **[PEP 529**][67] for more information and discussion of code modifications that may be required.
