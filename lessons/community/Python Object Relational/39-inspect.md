The `[inspect.signature()`][186] function now reports the implicit `.0` parameters generated by the compiler for comprehension and generator expression scopes as if they were positional-only parameters called `implicit0`. (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in [bpo-19611][187].)

To reduce code churn when upgrading from Python 2.7 and the legacy `[inspect.getargspec()`][188] API, the previously documented deprecation of `[inspect.getfullargspec()`][189] has been reversed. While this function is convenient for single/source Python 2/3 code bases, the richer `[inspect.signature()`][186] interface remains the recommended approach for new code.
