**[PEP 484**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484) introduced the standard for type **annotations** of function parameters, a.k.a. type hints. This PEP adds syntax to Python for annotating the types of variables including class variables and instance variables:
    
```python   
primes: List[int] = []

captain: str  # Note: no initial value!

class Starship:
    stats: Dict[str, int] = {}
```

Just as for function annotations, the Python interpreter does not attach any particular meaning to variable annotations and only stores them in the `__annotations__` attribute of a class or module.

In contrast to variable declarations in statically typed languages, the goal of annotation syntax is to provide an easy way to specify structured type metadata for third party tools and libraries via the abstract syntax tree and the `__annotations__` attribute.

: PEP written by Ryan Gonzalez, Philip House, Ivan Levkivskyi, Lisa Roach, and Guido van Rossum. Implemented by Ivan Levkivskyi.

Tools that use or will use the new syntax: [mypy][33], [pytype][34], PyCharm, etc.
