The `user` field is information about the person currently using your application. It should be a dictionary containing `id`, `email`, and/or `name`.

By default it is automatically populated with the `HttpRequest.user`. To override this behaviour see [customizing error reports](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/python/django/customizing-error-reports/).

That's it! We hope you enjoyed learning a little more about using [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/)
